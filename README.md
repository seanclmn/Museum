## Description

##### This project was started as a way for people to explore art museums from around the country safely during a pandemic. As of right now, there are only two museums available: the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. The Met's tab has both a general search page and a departments page where you can explore the different departments of the museum. The Art Institute of Chicago has a general search page but the departments page is still under construction. Both tabs also have a "learn about" link which will link you to information about each museum. <br/> The data is pulled in via publically available Web APIs deployed by the museums themselves. This web app is deployed via heroku.
